WASHINGTON — President Obama, seeking to regain his footing amid persistent questions over last September’s attack in Benghazi, Libya, called on Congress on Thursday to take action to bolster security at American Embassies.

Mr. Obama made his appeal during a midday news conference with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. He also urged lawmakers to fully finance the State Department’s budget request for diplomatic security.

“I’m calling on Congress to work with us and support and fully fund our budget request,” the president said, adding that Congress should provide new authority to put in place security changes at diplomatic posts. “We need to come together and truly honor the sacrifices” of those who died in Benghazi.

The administration has come under harsh criticism from Republicans for lapses in security during the attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. But the White House has complained that Congress actually cut financing for diplomatic security.

Among other steps, Mr. Obama asked for Congressional support to increase the number of Marine guards posted at embassies and for Congress to act in areas that could help fulfill recommendations detailed in an independent investigation of the Benghazi attack.

In January, the State Department proposed legislation that would allow future investigative bodies to recommend disciplinary action based on demonstrated poor leadership during security incidents. Another measure, already being taken up by Congress, would allow the State Department to redirect money in its budget to bolster security.

The president also pledged to work with the Pentagon to speed up the response time of military teams in cases where diplomatic facilities come under attack.

Lawmakers criticized the administration for not dispatching fighter jets to fly over the Benghazi compound after the first wave of attacks by militants. The independent investigation — which is being led by a former ambassador, Thomas R. Pickering, and Adm. Mike Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — concluded that military intervention would not have prevented the deaths of the Americans.

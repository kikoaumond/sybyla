'''Salomon Eberhard Henschen''' (28 February 1847, [[Uppsala]] - 16 December 1930) was a Swedish [[neurologist]].

Beginning in 1862, he studied medicine at [[Uppsala]], later conducting [[botanical]] research in [[Brazil]] from 1867 to 1869. After his return to Sweden, he continued his medical studies at Uppsala, then furthering his education in [[Stockholm]] (1874) and [[Leipzig]] (1877).

From 1878, he worked in the institute of [[pathology]] at the [[University of Uppsala]], while in the meantime, practicing medicine at the summer resort in [[Ronneby]]. In 1882 he was named professor and director at the clinic of [[internal medicine]] in Uppsala. From 1900, he worked at the [[Karolinska Institute]] in Stockholm.

Henschen is known for his investigations of [[aphasia]], as well as his systematic studies involving the [[Visual system|visual components/pathways of the brain]]. His ''Klinische und anatomische Beiträge zur Pathologie des Gehirns'' (Clinical and anatomical contributions to the pathology of the brain) was published over 25 editions from 1890 to 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-nr96-21021 WorldCat Identities] (publications)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 he described [[dyscalculia]], and later introduced the term &quot;[[acalculia]]&quot; to define the impairment of mathematical abilities in individuals with [[brain damage]] (1925).&lt;ref&gt;[http://dyscalculiaforum.com/forum/viewthread.php?thread_id=357 The Dyscalculia Forum] News about Dyscalculia...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medlink.com/medlinkcontent.asp Neurology MedLink] Acalculia, Clinical Summary&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897 he became a member of the [[Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. In 1923/24, he was one of a small group of neurologists who attended to [[Lenin]], following the Soviet leader's third and final stroke. With his son, Folke Henschen (1881-1977), he collaborated on an [[autopsy]] of Lenin's brain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plants.jstor.org/person/bm000003574 JSTOR Plant Science] Henschen, Salomon Eberhard (1847-1930)&lt;/ref&gt;

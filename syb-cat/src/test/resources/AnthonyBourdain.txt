Anthony Michael Bourdain (born June 25, 1956) is an American chef, author, and television personality. He is well known for his 2000 book Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly, and since 2005 he has hosted the Travel Channel's culinary and cultural adventure programs Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations and The Layover. In 2013, he joined CNN to host Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown.
A 1978 graduate of the Culinary Institute of America and a veteran of numerous professional kitchens,[1] Bourdain is a chef-at-large whose home base is Brasserie Les Halles in New York, where he was executive chef for many years.[2]


Anthony Bourdain was born in New York City, to Gladys and Pierre Bourdain (d. 1987).[3][4][5] He grew up in Leonia, New Jersey, and attended the Dwight-Englewood School.[6] Bourdain's paternal grandparents were French; his paternal grandfather emigrated from Arcachon to New York following World War I.[7] Bourdain's mother worked for The New York Times as a staff editor.[8] Bourdain graduated from Englewood School for Boys in 1973[9] and attended Vassar College before dropping out after two years. He graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in 1978.
Bourdain married his high-school girlfriend, Nancy Putkoski, in the 1980s, and they remained together for two decades before divorcing; Bourdain has cited the irrevocable changes that come from traveling widely as the cause of the split.[10] He currently lives with his second wife, Ottavia Busia. Together, they have a daughter, Ariane, born on April 9, 2007; the couple wed on April 20, 2007.[11] Busia has appeared in several episodes of No Reservations — notably the episode on Sardinia, her birthplace; the Tuscany episode, in which she plays a disgruntled Italian diner; the Rome episode, and the Naples episode.
Culinary training and career[edit]

In Kitchen Confidential, Bourdain describes how his love of food was kindled in France, when he tried his first oyster on an oyster fisherman's boat as a youth, while on a family vacation. Later, while attending Vassar College, he worked in the seafood restaurants of Provincetown, Massachusetts, which sparked his decision to pursue cooking as a career. Bourdain graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in 1978, and went on to run various restaurant kitchens in New York City – including the Supper Club, One Fifth Avenue, and Sullivan's – culminating in the position of executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles, beginning in 1998. Brasserie Les Halles is based in Manhattan, with additional locations in Miami and, at the time of Bourdain's tenure, Washington, D.C. and Tokyo, Japan.

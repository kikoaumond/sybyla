<p><a title="selling home in bad real estate market" href="http://cashmoneylife.com/selling-your-home-in-a-down-market/"><strong>Selling your home in a down market</strong></a> is tough. It took us 7 months from the time we listed our house until the time we finalize the sale, and we lost just over $50,000 on the transaction. I have conflicting thoughts about losing this much money. Obviously, no  one sets out to lose money when they buy a home, and no one feels good  about it. But at the same time, I realize it&#8217;s probably not as bad as it  seems.</p>
<h2>Thoughts on losing money on our house</h2>
<p>We knew we would lose money on the transaction, so we were prepared for it. Being mentally and emotionally prepared to lose money is important. In the grand scheme of things, we just considered losing money on our home a sunk cost and decided to move on. Here are some factors which made the loss easier to swallow:</p>
<p><strong>We had enough equity to cover our losses.</strong> Losing money  isn&#8217;t fun. Writing someone a check when you&#8217;ve already lost a lot of  money is even worse. Thankfully, we had  enough equity to cover our losses, so we didn&#8217;t have to write a check at closing. We put down 20% of the purchase price when we bought the home, and we <a title="should you pay off your mortgage early?" href="http://cashmoneylife.com/pay-off-mortgage-early-or-invest/"><strong>paid extra on our mortgage payments</strong></a>. This combination ensured we would receive a small check when we sold our home instead of being upside down on our mortgage.</p>
<p><strong>If we didn&#8217;t buy, we would have paid rent. </strong>Some people say renting is throwing away money, but I disagree. Many people who rented during the real estate bubble avoided taking substantial losses when they had to move. And in our case, we may have actually come out slightly ahead, depending on how you slice the numbers. We lived in our home for just over 5 years. If we would have &#8220;thrown away money&#8221; on rent for 5 years, we probably would have lost the same amount of money, give or take a little. ($1,000/mo rent * 5 years = $60,000). Again, this doesn&#8217;t take into account other factors such as the time value of money as the down payment could have been invested, home repairs, or other expenses. Either way, we would have spent a lot of money on housing.</p>
<p><strong>We could have lost more money. </strong>The real estate market in our area of the US was hit pretty hard. We just left the Dayton, OH area, which lost tens of thousands of jobs, and for a period of time, it was in the top 10 for foreclosures. As you can imagine, that created an excess of inventory and decimated housing prices. Thankfully, our neighborhood was relatively insulated from the price drops compared to some of the other neighborhoods.</p>
<p><strong>Some people can&#8217;t afford to sell, even if they want to. </strong>The real estate markets in some locations are so bad that the majority of people are upside down on their homes and selling would mean having to fork over tens of thousands of dollars they don&#8217;t have. Many people are so far under in their mortgages that they decided the best course of action  was to <a title="should you walk away from your mortgage?" href="http://http://cashmoneylife.com/walk-away-from-mortgage/" class="broken_link"><strong>walk  away from their mortgage</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>We can make it up on the back end. </strong>We want to buy another home, and the saving grace for us is that real estate prices are lower in most places, hopefully making this a good buying opportunity for us. Our hope is that we can get more house for our money when we buy our next home. Our goal is to stay in our next home for the next 5-10 years, so hopefully things will turn out better the next time around.</p>
<p>All of these things may sound like rationalizations, and to some degree they are. But it  also serves as a reminder to myself and others that real estate isn&#8217;t a  guaranteed investment.</p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">M</span>y wife and I sold our home about a month ago, and unfortunately, we lost a lot of money on the transaction. We knew we would lose money before we even put our home up for sale &#8211; housing prices have dropped substantially since we made the purchase and the inventory in our market was flooded with foreclosures and other homes (there was a 15 month inventory on the market when we listed our home for sale). All signs were pointing toward us taking a big loss on our home &#8211; and we did.</p>
<p>Our story isn&#8217;t unique &#8211; people around the country are facing similarly depressed real estate markets and many people <a title="what to do when you can't sell your home" href="http://themilitarywallet.com/options-cant-sell-home/"><strong>can&#8217;t sell their house</strong></a> for a variety of reasons. If they must sell, people are forced to sell at a loss, which brings both  financial and <a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/psychology-selling-house-loss/"><strong>psychological challenges</strong></a>. The difficult markets are even causing some people to <a title="should you walk away from your mortgage?" href="http://cashmoneylife.com/walk-away-from-mortgage/"><strong>walk away from their mortgage</strong></a>.</p>
<h3>Wait it out if you can &#8211; but don&#8217;t let it stop you if you have to move</h3>
<p>If ever ever there was a time to try and wait out a bad market, this is it. But not everyone can wait &#8211; you may need a larger home for a growing family, your job may take you elsewhere, or you may have to move for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>Our decision to sell was two fold: We needed a larger home for our growing family and we wanted to relocate to be closer to my wife&#8217;s family. We didn&#8217;t have the luxury of waiting out the markets, and renting wasn&#8217;t a good option either. So we decided to sell our home.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the real estate market took a huge hit since we purchased the home in 2005, and our area had a glut of foreclosures. So we were forced to initially list our home for $25,000 less than we had in it. Nothing like taking a $25,000 hit before you even sell your home!</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn&#8217;t stop at the list price &#8211; you also need to take other expenses into consideration &#8211; closing costs, real estate agent commissions, taxes, <a title="do you need a home warranty?" href="http://cashmoneylife.com/do-you-need-a-home-warranty/"><strong>home warranty</strong></a>, and other fees. The initial estimate was that we would lose in excess of $40,000&#8230; and we were right.</p>
<h3>Accepting the offer on our home</h3>
<p>Fast forward 6 months. We received an offer on our home almost exactly 6 months after we listed it. The offer was for $40,000 less than we had in the home. This was the first real offer we received and we wanted to accept it. So we made a small counteroffer. They asked for a $10,000 price reduction from the list price, and we countered with a $7,000 price reduction. We didn&#8217;t ask to meet halfway because we didn&#8217;t want to lose the sale. In retrospect they probably expected to meet halfway and we probably would have gotten it. But at that point I wasn&#8217;t willing to lose a sale over $2,000. The buyers accepted the counteroffer right away, so we were good to go.</p>
<p>Wrapping it up. After we agreed upon a sale price we just had to dot the i&#8217;s and cross the t&#8217;s. We paid the closing costs, commissions, a few minor repairs found in the house inspection, taxes, fees, and other expenses.  Altogether, we ended up losing just over $50,000*.</p>
<p class="note">*This isn&#8217;t a perfect calculation when you take into account factors such as time value of money, interest, etc. It&#8217;s simply a calculation of the purchase price minus the final sale price, commissions, fees and associated costs.</p>
<p><strong>Losing money is a tough pill to swallow, but it isn&#8217;t the end of the world.</strong> Now that I&#8217;ve had a month to digest this, it isn&#8217;t as bad as it first appears. Yes, we lost $50,000. That&#8217;s tough to swallow. But we also get to move on with our lives &#8211; we aren&#8217;t locked into a house which is too small for us and we get to live closer to family, which is priceless. But there are several more reasons why I&#8217;m not too upset about losing $50,000. And I&#8217;ll tell you all about it tomorrow. <img src='http://cashmoneylife.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p><span class="drop_cap">J</span>ust last week I wrote about <a href="http://cashmoneylife.com/my-smart-phone-is-not-so-smart/"><strong>my smart phone not being so smart</strong></a>. Well, that changed this week when I bought a new phone, an HTC Evo 4G from Sprint. To say it is an improvement over my previous phone is an understatement. I had my previous cell phone for over 4 years, and since I&#8217;m not an early adopter of technology, it had already been on the market several months when I got it.</p>
<p>Though I&#8217;m not one to rush out and buy something on launch day, I do appreciate quality, so I try to buy at or near the top of the market when I do buy. That way I know I&#8217;m getting something which is high quality and should last a long time. I hope my HTC Evo lasts me as long as my last phone did.</p>
<p><strong>About the cost of the phone. </strong>The phone was $199 after a $100 rebate. I&#8217;m not too worried about the upfront cost, because as I mentioned, I tend to keep my electronics for a long time. My main concern is the ongoing service plan, which is where most of the cost lies. And the monthly service plan is the reason I don&#8217;t have an iPhone. I&#8217;ve been <a title="cancel cell phone contract without fees" href="http://http://cashmoneylife.com/cancel-your-cell-phone-contract-without-paying-fees/" class="broken_link"><strong>out of contract</strong></a> for well over a year now and could have (and would have) bought an iPhone ages ago if the monthly service wasn&#8217;t so expensive. (more tips for <a title="how to save money on your cell phone bill" href="http://cashmoneylife.com/cell-phone-bill-reduce-save-money/"><strong>saving money on your cell phone bill</strong></a>).</p>
<p>Thankfully, I was able to get a very good deal on the plan. Several years ago I signed up for the Sprint SERO plan, which was a ridiculously good deal. The plan is no longer available, and the HTC Evo wasn&#8217;t even eligible for that plan, so I had to upgrade to the SERO Premium, which runs $40 a month for 500 minutes and unlimited data. It also includes Any Mobile Anytime and Unlimited GPS Navigation. The 4G phone requires an additional $10 per month for data, even though I live just outside the 4G service area. But I&#8217;m OK with the extra $10 charge &#8211; I get 500 minutes, unlimited data and GPS, and mobile to mobile calls for $50 a month, which is a very good deal compared to the data plans at many other carriers.</p>
<p><strong>As for the HTC Evo &#8211; it&#8217;s simply amazing.</strong> I&#8217;ve had an iPod Touch for over a year and I am familiar with the &#8220;smart phone&#8221; aspects of the iPod Touch and the iOS (Iphone/iPod operating system). But the HTC Evo beats it hands down. It took a day or so to get used to the Andoid OS, but overall I like it better than the iOS. There are some quirks and some more features I need to learn, but overall I&#8217;m happy with the phone. It was well worth the wait. I can&#8217;t wait to see what they come out with 3 years from now! <img src='http://cashmoneylife.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

They launched several years ago with a splash when they offered free stock trades. Zecco no longer offers free trades, but their pricing tiers are competitive with all the major players in the industry, and in many cases, are quite a bit lower.</p>
<h2>Zecco Review &#8211; King of Low Cost Trading</h2>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://cashmoneylife.com/resources/zecco.php" target="_top"><img class="alignright" src="http://www.ftjcfx.com/image-2365118-10468656" border="0" alt="" width="120" height="240" /></a><strong>Industry Awards.</strong> Zecco has received several awards for their trading platform, commissions, and other features. Zecco has received high rankings in the annual brokerage reviews performed by magazines such as Kiplinger&#8217;s, SmartMoney, and Barron&#8217;s.</p>
<p><strong>Fee schedule</strong>. Let&#8217;s start off with one of Zecco&#8217;s most attractive features, and something people almost always look at first &#8211; pricing. Zecco offers standard stock trades for a flat $4.95 per trade, with $0.65 options contracts. Penny stocks (defined as those which cost less than $1 per share) cost a flat $6.95 per trade, which is a better pricing plan than many competitors, which charge a penny per share (which adds up quickly if you are buying or selling thousands of shares). There are no account minimums or inactivity fess to worry about with Zecco. Here is <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cashmoneylife.com/resources/zecco.php" target="_blank">more information about Zecco&#8217;s fees</a>.</p>
<h3>Investment Options at Zecco</h3>
<p><strong>Investments offered</strong>. <a title="Zecco Discount Brokerage" rel="nofollow" href="http://cashmoneylife.com/resources/zecco.php" target="_blank">Zecco</a> gives investors the opportunity to research and purchase purchase stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds, CDs, Bonds, foreign currencies and precious metals. Investors can trade via options, market and limit orders, trade on margin, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Retirement Accounts</strong>. Zecco offers investors the opportunity to open Traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, and Rollover IRAs. Zecco charges a $30 annual fee to manage IRAs.</p>
<p><strong>Dividend Reinvestments</strong>. Zecco offers free dividend reinvestments, but you can only purchase whole shares through Zecco, so any portion of your dividend payments left over after purchasing a whole share will be deposited as cash into your account. The good news is that your cash can at least earn some interest while you are waiting to invest it.</p>
<p><strong>Money Market Sweep Account</strong>. Zecco offers a money market sweep account so your cash can earn some interest while you are waiting to invest it in the stock market. You will need to request that your cash be added to the sweep fund for this to take effect. Zecco also has a checking account available for a $30 annual fee.</p>
<h3>Opening a Zecco Account</h3>
<p><a title="Zecco Discount Brokerage" rel="nofollow" href="http://cashmoneylife.com/resources/zecco.php" target="_blank">Opening a Zecco account</a> was an easy process which only took about 10 minutes. Be prepared to enter all of your personal information, as well as your employment information, stock trading experience, investing goals, etc. These are all standard requirements for opening a brokerage or other financial account.</p>
<h3>Transferring money at Zecco</h3>
<p><strong>Transferring money</strong>. You can fund your Zecco account with a check, via a money transfer, or with an ACH transaction. The easiest and cheapest option is an ACH transaction, which is how I chose to fund my account. ACH transactions are free and can be scheduled in advance, so they are the most flexible option. Keep in mind that ACH transactions take a few days to go through. Zecco advertises 2-3 day ACH transactions, but my transfer took 4 days to go through. That’s not a deal breaker in my book, but it is something to keep in mind. Zecco also offers <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cashmoneylife.com/resources/zecco.php" target="_blank"><strong>free incoming ACAT transfers</strong></a> if you wish to transfer your funds from your old brokerage account to your new Zecco account (keep in mind some brokerages charge outgoing ACAT transfer fees).</p>
<h3>Making trades at Zecco</h3>
<p><strong>Making trades.</strong> Zecco recently launched an updated trading interface which is very intuitive and easy to use. I have made a few trades already and they were executed as ordered. I am not an options trader, so I can’t give you too much feedback regarding <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cashmoneylife.com/resources/zecco.php" target="_blank"><strong>options trading with Zecco</strong></a>. However, I know customers have the ability to perform most common and advanced types of options trades, and there is a learning center feature that offers more information about options trades if you want to learn more information.</p>
<h3>Zecco’s Investment Research and Learning Center</h3>
<p><strong>Investment research</strong>. Zecco provides investors free access to investment research from Standard and Poor’s and a variety of free tools such as an options calculator and options analytics. There are also premium services available for those who are willing to pay for them. Among the options available to all Zecco members are the Zecco Streamer (pictured below), screening tools for stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds, quotes and research tools, tools for building your options strategy, GainsKeeper for tracking your gains and losses for tax purposes, and more.</p>

	<p class="wp-caption-text">Zecco Streamer</p>
</div>
<h3>Zecco Community and Education Center</h3>
<p><strong>ZeccoShare Community.</strong> Zecco offers a unique feature among discount brokerage firms &#8211; they have an investing community, ZeccoShare, which boasts over 100,000 investors and offers investing groups, forums, blogs, and the ability to create your own investor profile. There is a lot to be said about the community experience, especially if you are a beginning or active investor.</p>
<p><strong>Zecco learning center</strong>. Zecco has a host of stock  trading and research and analysis tools. The research tools and  tutorials cover topics pertinent to beginning investors as well as  advanced investors, and many of these tools are available to the public  for free, regardless of whether or not you have a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cashmoneylife.com/resources/zecco.php" target="_blank"><strong>Zecco account</strong></a>.</p>
<h3>iPhone App, Zap Trading and other Zecco features</h3>
<div id="attachment_5711" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 175px">
	<a rel="nofollow" href="http://cashmoneylife.com/resources/zecco.php" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-5711 " title="zecco-iphone-app" src="http://cashmoneylife.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/zecco-iphone-app.png" alt="Zecco iPhone App" width="175" height="340" /></a>
	<p class="wp-caption-text">Zecco iPhone App</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Zecco iPhone app. </strong>Zecco recently released their free iPhone app, Zecco Mobile Lite, which is already among the highest rated investment apps in the iTunes store. The iPhone app also works on the iPod Touch and iPad. The good news is that anyone can use it for stock research, updates, tracking your portfolio, maintaining a watchlist, real time streaming quotes, and free push alerts. The downside to the app is that you can&#8217;t make trades from it at this time. And if you&#8217;re like me and have an Android based phone, then don&#8217;t worry &#8211; the Android app is currently in development, but the Zecco rep I recently spoke with wasn&#8217;t allowed to give me a launch date at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Zap Trade.</strong> This is a truly unique feature which Zecco holds a patent to, so you won&#8217;t see it elsewhere. Zap Trade is a FireFox browser plugin which gives you the power to make trades from any web page once you are signed in. Zap Trade will automatically scan the website you are visiting and highlight any ticker symbols to give you easy access to more in-depth research on that stock, or the ability to trade that stock from that page. It&#8217;s a powerful tool for traders who know what they want.</p>
<p><strong>Premium investing tools</strong>. If you are a day trader,  you will want a tax planning tool to help you make the best decisions  regarding which shares to sell for the highest tax efficiency. Zecco offers a free integrated cost basis tool for all shares purchased in 2011 and going forward. Zecco also offers Gainskeeper, which is an industry recognized tool for tracking cost basis. There is an associate fee with the latter tool.</p>
<p><strong>Account records</strong>. Zecco keeps their costs down by automatically enrolling you in e-statements. You can receive paper statements for a fee.</p>
<h3>Zecco Customer Service</h3>
<p>Zecco offers e-mail, live chat, and telephone support through a free customer service number – 1.877.700.7862. Zecco’s FAQ section can take care of many questions, but if you need immediate assistance, you will need to call between the hours of 9am-6pm est, Mon-Fri.</p>
<h3>Security and insurance</h3>
<p><strong>Your money is safe with Zecco.</strong> Zecco is a member of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which is the largest non-governmental regulator for all securities firms doing business in the United States. Zecco is covered by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which is an organization that acts as insurance against your broker filing for bankruptcy or otherwise going under. Funds are available to meet customer claims up to a maximum of $500,000 in cash and securities with a $100,000 cash maximum. Zecco has additional coverage from Lloyds of London insurance and is secured through a VeriSign SSL Certificate to assure your confidential information remains secure.</p>
<p><strong>Trading Key</strong>. Before making a trade, Zecco members must enter a trading key &#8211; this is a separate step that occurs after logging in to their account. This prevents unauthorized users from causing some major damage to your account.</p>
<h3>My overall opinion of Zecco</h3>
<p>I think <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cashmoneylife.com/resources/zecco.php" target="_blank"><strong>Zecco is a quality trading platform</strong></a>, which certainly can&#8217;t be beat for the price. Zecco is a flexible brokerage and will meet the needs of many different types of investors &#8211; from the investor who buys and holds ETFs (such as myself) to the day trader who makes dozens of trades in a month. The biggest complaint that some people have is the additional expense of certain premium tools. But in my opinion, if you are trading often enough to need those tools, you are most likely saving a lot more money based on the average trade commission with Zecco compared to the average trade at another brokerage.

				<div class="format_text entry-content">
<p><span class="drop_cap">M</span>ovie rentals are gaining popularity as people more frequently decide to drop premium movie channels or cut the cord on cable altogether. And it makes a lot of sense &#8211; you can get access to thousands of movie titles on demand for the price of one month of a premium movie channel, and still have DVDs delivered to your door. This was all I needed to make the decision to drop cable.</p>
<p>The two most prominent online movie providers are Blockbuster and Netflix. They both offer a wide selection of movies and have a similar process for renting movies:  members select the movies they wish to rent and place them in a queue, then the company mails the movies to the member when they become available. Movies are mailed in a postage paid envelope and come with a postage paid return envelope for your convenience. All you need to do is watch the movie, put it in the postage paid envelope and drop it in the mail, and wait for your next movie to come.</p>
<p><strong>So which company is better? </strong>Let&#8217;s take a detailed look at their plans and see which one is best for your movie watching needs.</p>
<h2>Netflix vs. Blockbuster</h2>
<p>Since the service provided by Blockbuster and Netflix provide is very similar, let&#8217;s compare the two and see which features set them apart from each other.</p>

<h3>Common features between Netflix and Blockbuster</h3>
<p>There are quite a few standard features between Netflix and Blockbuster:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free shipping.</strong> Both Netflix and Blockbuster use postage paid envelopes for sending movies to and from their customers.</li>
<li><strong>No late fees.</strong> This is one of the biggest marketing features employed by Netflix and Blockbuster.</li>
<li><strong>Blue-Ray.</strong> Both Netflix and Blockbuster offer the next generation DVDs.</li>
<li><strong>On demand streaming.</strong> Netflix and Blockbuster both offer online movie streaming &#8211; in fact, the base Netflix plan <em>only</em> offers a streaming option. For an additional $2 per month, you can get 1 DVD at a time through Netflix, while 1 DVD at a time per month is standard at Blockbuster. That said, 1DVD at a time + streaming is still $2 cheaper per month with Netflix.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Unique features offered by Netflix</h3>
<p><strong>Netflix offers a streaming-only plan.</strong> Netflix doesn&#8217;t have any brick and mortar stores to offer in-store exchanges. Instead, Netflix is focusing on moving their business model to an online focus. In order to enjoy this feature to its max potential, you need to have a fast internet connection and a system capable of displaying high definition graphics. This could be through a PlayStation 3, Roku Box, Nintendo Wii, XBox 360, many types of Blu-Ray players, or a variety of other devices &#8211; which you may already own. There are currently over 20,000 titles to choose from for online viewing.</p>

	<a rel="nofollow" href="http://cashmoneylife.com/resources/netflix.php"><img class="size-large wp-image-4655" title="How-does-Netflix-work" src="http://cashmoneylife.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/How-does-Netflix-work-500x186.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="186" /></a>
	<p class="wp-caption-text">Stream unlimited movies online with Netflix</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Netflix Budget plan:</strong> Netflix also offers a budget plan for $4.99 which is limited to 2 DVDs per month. All other options feature unlimited DVDs or streaming, with the limit referring to how many DVDs you can have out at any given time.</p>
<h3>Unique features offered by Blockbuster</h3>
<p><strong>Blockbuster Offers In-store exchanges. </strong>Blockbuster  offers their customers the opportunity to exchange videos and games at a  brick and mortar location instead of sending the movies or games back  through the postal service. This allows customers the opportunity to  exchange movies more quickly than they otherwise would be able to.  However, this service is limited  to participating locations, and a cap  of 5 exchanges per month.</p>
<p><strong>Blockbuster gets some new releases more quickly.</strong> Blockbuster has contracts with some movie distributors to receive movies more quickly than Netflix, or their other competitor, RedBox. However, not all new releases fall under this embargo.</p>
<h3>Which is better &#8211; Netflix or Blockbuster?</h3>
<p>Both Netflix and Blockbuster offer customers good value for their money, depending on how often the customers rent videos. The plans are very similar, so which plan is best probably depends on how often you would use their unique features, namely the in-store exchanges or online streaming.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Netflix is better if:</strong> You have a high speed internet connection and the ability to stream online videos &#8211; they have a larger selection of movies to choose from, and receive high ratings in most online reviews. They also offer DVDs to your doorstep. Netflix is also cheaper than Blockbuster &#8211; with a streaming only plan $4 per month cheaper than the least expensive Blockbuster option, and lower prices for streaming + 1 or 2 DVDs at a time. <a title="Netflix Free Trial Offer" rel="nofollow" href="http://cashmoneylife.com/resources/netflix.php">Sign up for a free one month trial to Netflix</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Blockbuster is better if: </strong>You have a nearby Blockbuster store which participates in the rental exchange, and if having new releases a month earlier than Netflix is important to you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My preference?</strong> Netflix is the clear winner in my book. They offer cheaper plans, more movies, and better streaming options. That said, both companies offer solid value, and a cheaper alternative to paying for cable or premium movie channels.</p>
<p class="alert"><strong>Free trial offers.</strong> Both Blockbuster and Netflix offer free trials, so you can always try it free to determine which company and plan best meets your needs.  <a title="Netflix Free Trial Offer" rel="nofollow" href="http://cashmoneylife.com/resources/netflix.php">Netflix Free Trial Offer</a>.</p>

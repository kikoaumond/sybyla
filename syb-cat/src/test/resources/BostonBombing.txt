The men, Dias Kadyrbayev, 19, and Azamat Tazhayakov, 19, both citizens of Kazakhstan who are in the United States on student visas, appeared in court Wednesday afternoon after having been arrested earlier in the day.

A third man, Robel Phillipos, 19, of Cambridge, Mass., was charged with lying to federal law enforcement officials about what they said was his role in disposing of the material.

Mr. Phillipos hung his head in court, prompting Magistrate Judge, Marianne B. Bowler, to instruct him as she read him his rights: “I suggest you pay attention to me rather than looking down.”

All three suspects appeared in court in bluejeans. They were handcuffed and shackled at the ankles. They were taken into federal custody until their next court appearance.

Lawyers for the three men said outside the courthouse that their clients had had nothing to do with the bombings and had cooperated fully with the investigation.

“My client had no knowledge of the incident,” said Robert Stahl, who is representing Mr. Kadyrbayev, adding later, “He absolutely denies the charges, as we’ve said from the beginning.” He said his client was “shocked and horrified” by the bombings

Mr. Stahl did not deny that his client had taken a backpack with powder in it belonging to Mr. Tsarnaev, but said that his client had told the Federal Bureau of Investigation about it. “He didn’t know the items were involved in the bombing,” Mr. Stahl said.

Mr. Tazhayakov and Mr. Kadyrbayev have been in federal custody for more than a week on allegations they violated their student visas. Mr. Stahl said that Mr. Kadyrbayev was a sophomore engineering major and was in “technical violation of student visa for not regularly attending classes.”

Harlan Protass, a lawyer representing Mr. Tazhayakov, said his client “feels horrible and was shocked to hear that someone he knew was involved with the marathon bombing. He has cooperated fully with the authorities and looks forward to the truth coming out in this case. He considers it an honor to be able to study in the united states.”

Mr. Kadyrbayev and Mr. Tazhayakov are due back in court on May 14. They face a maximum of five years in prison and $250,000 in fines.

Derege M. Demissie, the lawyer representing Mr. Phillipos, who was arrested Wednesday and charged separately with making false statements, said that his client was innocent and that the details would come out in court. He is due back in court on Monday and faces a maximum sentence of 8 years and a $250,000 fine.

Two explosives detonated April 15 near the finish line of the marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 260 others.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, are suspected of having set off the bombs. Tamerlan, 26, was killed in a shootout with the police, while Dzhokhar was charged with using a weapon of mass destruction.

He was transferred last week from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, where he was being treated for multiple gunshot wounds, to a locked medical facility for male prisoners at Fort Devens.

The three men charged on Wednesday began attending the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth in 2011, at the same time as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Mr. Tsarnaev became particularly close to Mr. Kadyrbayev and Mr. Tazhayakov, who would frequently visit his family members, an affidavit filed in the case said.

Mr. Kadyrbayev told the authorities that he suspected that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had been involved in the marathon bombings when he went to his friend’s dorm room with the others three days after the attacks and noticed that several tubes that had previously contained fireworks had been emptied of their powder.

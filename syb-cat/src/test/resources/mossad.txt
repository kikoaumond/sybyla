The Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations, otherwise known as the Mossad, has been appointed by the State of Israel to collect information, analyze intelligence, and perform special covert operations beyond its borders.

Preventing terrorist acts against Israeli targets abroad.
Developing and maintaining special diplomatic and other covert relations.

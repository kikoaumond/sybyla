     July 25 (Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. Chief Executive
Officer Mark Zuckerberg’s decision last year to bet big on
mobile software is paying off, with sales of ads on wireless
devices now on track to surpass revenue from desktop computers.
     Surging demand for mobile advertising helped profit and
revenue top analysts’ estimates in the second quarter yesterday.
The results sent shares of the world’s most popular social-
networking service up as much as 28 percent, a record intraday
gain, to the highest level since May 2012.
     The earnings may finally quiet concerns, voiced by analysts
and investors since Facebook’s initial public offering last
year, that the rising popularity of smartphones and tablets is
outpacing its ability to make money selling promotions to mobile
users. By letting marketers show messages in the news feed on
such devices, and shifting development efforts toward
applications, Zuckerberg is delivering on his promise of making
Facebook a “mobile-first” company, according to Jordan Rohan,
an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in New York.
     “There’s latent demand for marketers to spend money on
Facebook,” Rohan, who rates the shares a buy, said in an
interview. “The company finally introduced the right set of ad
products to facilitate that.”
     Revenue rose 53 percent to $1.81 billion in the latest
quarter, the company said in a statement yesterday. Profit
excluding certain items was 19 cents a share. Analysts had
projected profit of 14 cents on sales of $1.62 billion on
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

                         Blowout Quarter

     Facebook jumped 25 percent to $33.17 at 10:58 a.m. in New
York, and earlier traded as high as $34. Analysts at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. increased their target price to $46 from $40,
and at least 10 others also boosted projections, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. About 192 million shares changed
hands, the most since November and more than four times the
average this year, the data show.
     “Finally, the blowout quarter that Facebook bulls have
been waiting for,” said Paul Sweeney, an analyst at Bloomberg
Industries. “Among many impressive data points, I think
investors will focus on the percentage of revenue from mobile of
41 percent, which was well above consensus.”
     Facebook, which had priced its IPO at $38 a share, saw its
stock slump as low as $17.55 in September. Even after today’s
gain, the stock is 11 percent below its initial offering price.
Concern about Facebook’s ability to shift to mobile has weighed
on the company’s shares since its $16 billion IPO, the largest
technology offering on record.
     Even with the decline, the Menlo Park, California-based
company traded at 115 times earnings as of yesterday’s close,
more expensive than 98 percent of the companies in the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

                           Mobile Push

     Mobile ads, which made up 30 percent of revenue in the
first quarter, will soon account for more than half of
advertising dollars, Zuckerberg said on a conference call. The
number of mobile users expanded 51 percent to 819 million during
the quarter. The total number of Facebook members was 1.15
billion, compared with 1.11 billion in the earlier period.
     “This quarter represents a strong validation that we’re
effectively navigating the shift to mobile,” David Ebersman,
Facebook’s chief financial officer, said in an interview. “All
the investments we’ve been making in the business have been
paying off.”
     Facebook is projected to take 13 percent of the global
mobile-advertising market this year, up from 5.4 percent last
year, according to EMarketer Inc. Even so, the company remains a
distant No. 2 to Google Inc., which is expected to grab 56
percent of the market in 2013.
     Facebook has stepped up efforts with its mobile services,
including updates to its smartphone applications and a new video
feature for photo-sharing service Instagram.

                           Daily Users

     Net income attributable to shareholders was $333 million,
or 13 cents a share, compared with a loss of $157 million, or 8
cents, a year earlier.
     More than half, or 61 percent, of Facebook members use the
site daily, a number that has risen even as management projected
it would decline, Zuckerberg said on the call.
     “As we’ve grown, I always expected our ratio of daily
actives to monthly actives would decrease as later technology
adopters joined our service,” Zuckerberg said. “The opposite
has actually been true.”
     Revenue from payments, which includes virtual goods sold in
games such as “FarmVille 2” and “Candy Crush Saga,” grew to
$214 million in the second quarter, a gain of 11 percent from a
year earlier.
     The company lowered its estimate on capital expenditures
this year to $1.6 billion, down from its earlier forecast of
$1.88 billion, due to efficiency gains and the timing of planned
purchases, Ebersman said on the call.

                         Marketing Tools

     Facebook is also making improvements to its advertising
tools for marketers. The company said last month it intends to
cut its 27 ad units by more than half, making the promotion-
buying process more simple and efficient.
     The social-networking provider has been wooing more large
advertisers. In April, Facebook won back General Motors Co. as a
customer almost a year after the automaker said it was pulling
ads off the service.
     “It’s been pretty clear for a long time that Facebook
could monetize its 1.1 billion users a lot better,” Michael
Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los Angeles,
said in an interview. “It may sound simple, but we always knew
that if they would just try harder, they could deliver.”

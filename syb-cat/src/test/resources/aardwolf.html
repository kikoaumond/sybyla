<html><head><title>Aardwolf - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title><body><h1>Aardwolf</h1>The aardwolf (Proteles cristata) is a small, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomophagy">insectivorous</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyena">hyena</a>, native to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Africa">Eastern</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Africa">Southern Africa</a>. The name means "earth wolf" in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language">Dutch</a>. It is also called "maanhaar jackal". Unlike other hyenas, the diet of the aardwolf almost completely consists of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termite">termite</a>s, other insect larvae and carrion.<br>The aardwolf is the only surviving species of the subfamily Protelinae. Two subspecies are recognized: Proteles cristatus cristatus of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Africa">Southern Africa</a>, and Proteles cristatus septentrionalis of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Africa">eastern</a> and northeastern Africa. It is usually placed in the Hyaenidae, though formerly separated into the family Protelidae. The aardwolf lives in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrubland">scrubland</a>s of eastern and southern Africa. These are the areas of land covered with stunted trees or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub">shrub</a>s. The aardwolf hides in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrow">burrow</a> during the day and comes out at night to search for food. It is related to hyenas, but unlike its relatives, it does not hunt large prey. This unusual animal is a mass killer of insects. It feeds mainly on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termite">termite</a>s and can eat more than 200,000 in a single night, using its long, sticky tongue to collect them.
<h2>Physical characteristics</h2>
The aardwolf looks like a very small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striped_Hyena">Striped Hyena</a>. They have a more slender <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snout">muzzle</a>, sharper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear">ear</a>s utilized in the hunt for harvester termites, black vertical stripes on a coat of yellowish fur, and a long, distinct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mane">mane</a> down the middle line of the neck and back, which is raised during a confrontation to make the aardwolf's size appear bigger. It is 55–80 cm (22–31 in) long, excluding its bushy 20–30 cm (8–12 in) tail, stands about 40–50 cm (16–20 in) at the shoulder, and weighs between 9 and 14 kg (20–31 lb). Its front feet have 5 toes, unlike other hyenas which have four toes. Its teeth and skull are similar to that of the hyena, although the cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects, and its tongue for licking them up. As the aardwolf ages, it will normally lose some of its teeth, though this has little impact on their feeding habits due to the soft nature of the insects they consume. It has two glands at the rear that secrete a musky fluid for marking territory and communicating with other aardwolves.
<h2>Distribution and habitat</h2>
The aardwolf lives on open, dry plains and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushland">bushland</a>,  avoiding mountainous areas. Due to its specific food requirements, the animal is only found in regions where termites of the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodotermitidae">Hodotermitidae</a> occur. Termites of this family depend on dead and withered grass and are most populous in heavily grazed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassland">grassland</a>s and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah">savannah</a>s, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arable_land">farmland</a>. For most of the year, aardwolves spend time in shared territories consisting of up to a dozen dens which are occupied for six weeks at a time.<br>There are two distinct populations: one in Southern Africa, and another in East and Northeast Africa. The species does not occur in the intermediary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miombo">miombo</a> forests.
<h2>Behavior</h2>
Aardwolves are shy and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal_animal">nocturnal</a>, sleeping in underground burrows by day. They usually use existing burrows of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aardvark">aardvark</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World_porcupine">Old World porcupine</a>s or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springhare">springhare</a>s, despite being capable of creating their own. By night, an aardwolf can consume up to 200,000 harvester <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termites">termites</a> using its sticky, long tongue. They take special care not to destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony, which ensures that the termites can rebuild and provide a continuous supply of food. They will often memorise and return to nests to save the trouble of finding a new one. They are also known to feed on other insects, larvae, and eggs, and occasionally small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammals">mammals</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds">birds</a>. Unlike other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyena">hyena</a>s, aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals.<br>The adult aardwolf is primarily solitary while foraging for food, necessary because of the scarcity and homogeneous distribution of their insect prey. They have often been mistaken for solitary animals. In fact, they live as monogamous pairs, with their young, defending the same territory. Young aardwolves generally achieve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_maturity">sexual maturity</a> after two years, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeding_season">breeding season</a> varies depending on their location, but normally takes place during the autumn or spring. During the breeding season, unpaired male aardwolves will search their own territory as well as others' for a female to mate with. Dominant males will also mate opportunistically with the females of less dominant neighboring aardwolves. This can often result in conflict between two male aardwolves when one has wandered into another's territory. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation">Gestation</a> lasts between 90 and 110 days, producing one to five <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubs">cubs</a> (most often two or three) during the rainy season, when termites are active. The first six to eight weeks are spent in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Den">den</a> with the mother. After three months, they begin supervised foraging and by four months are normally independent. However, they will often use the same den as their mother until the next breeding season. They can achieve a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy">lifespan</a> of up to 15 years when in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captivity_(animal)">captivity</a>.
<h2>Interaction with humans</h2>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture">Agriculture</a> may create a negative impact on their population due to use of poisons by farmers. They are often considered useful, non-dangerous animals by farmers. However, in some areas the aardwolf is hunted for its fur. Encounters with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog">dog</a>s are another threat.

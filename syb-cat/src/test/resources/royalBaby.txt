According to the official Web site of the British monarchy, and to the Sun’s Royal Baby Monitor, the Duchess of Cambridge (actually, let’s call her Kate Middleton—one of the nice things about being Americans is that we stopped having to yes-ma’am aristocrats and their wives two hundred and thirty-seven years ago) has been admitted to St. Mary’s Hospital, in London, in the early stages of labor. This is a celebratory occasion in Britain, the blockbuster sequel to a successful royal wedding. It is also an opportunity for the royal family—as corporate a body as any, except when it comes to paying taxes—to deploy some self-flattering public relations. Once the baby is born, a royal aide bearing a foolscap proclamation will proceed from the Lindo Wing of the hospital to the forecourt of Buckingham Palace, where word of the baby’s sex will be posted on an easel behind the palace gates. William is taking paternity leave, unlike his father or grandfather, who was playing squash when the former was born.

Foolscap, an easel, a prince with a pacifier: it’s good, old-fashioned, newfangled fun—and here I am, raining on the parade with the pissy insistence of a London squall. But there is nothing like living in a constitutional monarchy to turn one into a republican. The birth of a royal baby, particularly, underscores the medieval nature of the institution—the hard, creepy bloodstockiness of a caste system enshrined in law. As Hilary Mantel wrote in the London Review of Books, “Long before Kate’s big news was announced, the tabloids wanted to look inside her to see if she was pregnant. Historians are still trying to peer inside the Tudors. Are they healthy, are they sick, can they breed?” We have been performing a collective sonogram on Kate since April, 2011. What about royalty makes the rest of us so eager to play the scuttling midwife, just grateful to get a look at the heir?

It’s forever surprising to me how many British friends, believers in egalitarian values in every other realm, subscribe to the view that the royal family is powerless, harmless, and largely deserving, in some unquestionable way, of the immense privilege that it hoards. I never win this argument at the dinner table. But, as the anti-monarchy group Republic points out, the British monarchy costs ten times as much as the German presidency. The royal family exerts hard power and soft pressure while exempting itself from such forms of accountability as the National Audit Office and the Freedom of Information Act. It is the official social superiority of the royal family, however, that strikes me as most antithetical to a democratic society. (I realize that this is considered a hopelessly naïve American point of view. Sort out your health-care system, my friends would say, and then we’ll talk about inequality.) Republic writes:

Occupying the palaces we have a family of fairly ordinary, uninspiring individuals who represent the very worst of Britain: snobbish, elitist and utterly out of touch with the rest of the country. The Windsors just keep on taking from the taxpayer and give very little back. Despite doing little and achieving even less, they demand respect and deference from everyone. The most talented and accomplished commoner is expected to defer to princes Harry and William. Scientists, architects and a host of other professionals who have earned doctorates and professorships, are lectured and patronised by Charles who demands he be heard and taken seriously for no reason other than his rank.
My colleague Amy Davidson considered the recent push to alter the laws of succession so that a firstborn daughter will enjoy the same status as her brothers to be a step in the right direction—but as a stab at progressivism, it’s akin to an all-white country club admitting women. A female baby Cambridge will be equal to a male one, but we will all be inferior to any of them. According to the Web site of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, one of Kate’s primary areas of concern is “young people—helping children and young people to build their skills, confidence and aspirations.” It would be interesting to know how she would explain to them that her child already has a lock on becoming the head of state.

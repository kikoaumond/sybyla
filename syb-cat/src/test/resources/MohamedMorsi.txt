The Cairo middle-schooler had given a video interview to a local news site last fall, in which he presented an eloquent and seemingly ad-lib take-down of Islamist governance and then-President Mohamed Morsi. Mohamed’s answers were so detailed—“fascist theocracy is when you manipulate religion and enforce extremist regulations in the name of religion,” he said—that they seemed to take his questioner off-guard.

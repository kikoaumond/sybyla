Trim and tidy in a worn white blazer, his hair cut for Sunday, José Batista da Silva kneels on the cement floor and prays. The 56-year-old former bus driver knows every hymn at the Sanctuary of the Byzantine Rosary, Father Marcelo Rossi’s Catholic megachurch in São Paulo, where he has attended mass for the past six years. Today he is hoping for a little extra blessing. 

Batista’s head is bowed and his arms stretch toward the skylight. In each hand he grasps a pocket-size passbook, the document Brazilians use to register employment contracts. Both he and his daughter Samanta, age 23, are out of work, and Batista, who sustained a back injury on the job, saw his disability pension cut in 2007. But among the 10,000 faithful who have gathered here to worship, sway, and bear witness as Father Marcelo sets the gospel to song, he draws comfort. “Everyone prays and sings. Here, it feels like God opens His heart a little wider to us,” he says. “Father Marcelo is bringing back people to church.”
